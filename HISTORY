new features in this release.

2.5.0-beta.1
============

* The `thingpedia-client` library was imported here. It includes
  the loaders for Thingpedia devices and the configuration mixins.
  The goal is that `thingpedia` will become a sufficient library
  to consume Thingpedia devices without a full instance of Almond.
  To this end, the import also includes new classes `BasePlatform`
  and `BaseEngine`, which provide the full extend of the engine
  and platform API that is guaranteed to be available to Thingpedia
  devices [#26].
* The configuration interface for Thingpedia devices was revamped and cleaned.
  Devices can now implement the following hooks:
  - `static loadFromOAuth2`: to configure a device using plain OAuth 2.0
  - `static loadFromCustomOAuth` + `static completeCustomOAuth`:
    to configure a device with custom OAuth-like flows
  - `static loadFromDiscovery` + `completeDiscovery` for local
    discovery (Bluetooth, UPnP)
  - `static loadInteractively` for interactive (dialog-based) configuration
  Devices using these hooks should return a new instance of themselves,
  and not call any engine method. The old mechanism, based on
  `loadOneDevice`, will continue to be supported but is deprecated
  and will go away in the next major version [#10, #26].
* New API: `BaseDevice.platform` is a simpler way to access platform-specific
  APIs from device implementations [#13, #26].
* `BaseDevice.engine` is now deprecated and should not be used [#26].
* `ObjectSet` and `RefCounted` are now exposed as `Helpers`; the old
  names are still accessible but are deprecated [#27].
* New API: `Preferences` & `Helpers.FilePreferences`; this is a simple
  persistent key-value store and provides the interface and usual
  implementation of `Platform.getSharedPreferences()`.
* Thingpedia devices can now include the `#[handle_thingtalk]` annotation
  on their functions; if so, only a single `query` method per class is expected,
  instead of one `get_` method per Thingpedia function [#28].
* Updated dependencies [#24, #25, #29].
